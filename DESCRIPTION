Description: This package implemens some correction tools for morphometric variables
  that are allometrically linked to some undderlying confounding variable, such as 
  body size. It attempts at correcting caveats that arise in previous methods when
  multiple groups are considered and compared, such as in studies of sexual dimorphism
  in traits that must first be corrected for body size.
