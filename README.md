# allocorrect

This is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package providing tools to correct for allometric relatonships between traits of interest and confounding variables in geometric morphometrics (e.g. correcting for body size). We highlight the problems with existing methods in the `*.html` page present here (should be turned into a vignette but this package is under construction). Our proposed method comes in particularly handy when dealing with multiple groups that may differ in allometry.

## In the works

Currently the package works only with sexual dimorphism, we are working on making it more flexible and capable of handling more than two groups.
