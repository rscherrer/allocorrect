# dimorphic-allometries

This repo contains [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code to show how existing methods of correction for allometric relationships between traits can be misleading when studying between-groups differences such as sexual dimorphism. Here we offer a proof-of-concept approach to properly correct for such allometries when said allometries are themselves sexually dimorphic.
